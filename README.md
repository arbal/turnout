# Turnout

Let's suppose for some reason your ISP is incapable to grant you reliable access to some websites. In such case, many of us ended up with a dual-connection plan.

A main connection provided by the ISP as is, is complemented by a second connection circumventing the weakness of the first. The second route is usually metered, and accessible via a SOCKS5 interface.

Turnout is aimed to give users smooth browsing experience while minimizing the traffic ($$$) incurred on the metered connection, by doing smart routing in the background.
