// This program was designed to select routes automatically.
// You are encouraged to install as few custom rules as possible.

// In transparent proxy mode, hostnames are sniffed from HTTP and TLS packets.
// However, this might not always work, such as due to encrypted SNI.

// Format (Remove the leading // to take effect)
// Rules are matched in order

//1 sample.com   Exact match (via route 1)
