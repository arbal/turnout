// Turnout host rules

// This program was designed to select routes automatically.
// You are encouraged to install as few custom rules as possible.

// In transparent proxy mode, hostnames are sniffed from HTTP and TLS packets.
// However, this might not always work, such as due to encrypted SNI.

// Rules are matched from top to bottom and have higher priority than IP rules.
// Destinations with specific routes are exempt from speed check.

// Format (Remove the leading // to take effect)
//1 baidu.com        Domain match (match *.baidu.com and baidu.com to route 1)
//1 "www.baidu.com"  Exact match
//1 *.baidu.com      Wildcard match (match www.baidu.com but not baidu.com)
//2 *github*         Match any text containing github to route 2 (2 asterisks at most)
//-1 *pornhub*       Destinations with route -1 will be blocked
