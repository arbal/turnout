// Turnout host rules

// This program was designed to select routes automatically.
// You are encouraged to install as few custom rules as possible.

// In transparent proxy mode, hostnames are sniffed from HTTP and TLS packets.
// However, this might not always work, such as due to encrypted SNI.

// Rules are matched in order and have higher priority than IP rules.
// Destinations with specific routes are exempt from speed check.

// Format (Remove the leading // to take effect)
//1 sample.com   Exact match (via route 1)
//1 *.baidu.com  Wildcard match
//2 *github*     No more than 2 asterisks are allowed
//-1 *pornhub*   Destinations with route -1 will be blocked
