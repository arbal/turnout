// Turnout IP/CIDR rules

// This program was designed to select routes automatically.
// You are encouraged to install as few custom rules as possible.

// If a hostname is available it is passed to the SOCKS5 proxy and resolved by the proxy in some way Turnout does not know.
// Therefore the routing decision Turnout makes is based solely on the result from the system resolver.
// If the system resolver may provide bogus result, you need to take that into consideration when writing rules.

// Rule destinations should not be overlapping each other.
// Destinations with specific routes are exempt from speed check.

// Format (Remove the leading // to take effect)
//1 192.168.0.0/16   Select route 1
//2 8.8.8.8          Select route 2
//-1 31.13.0.0/16    Destinations with route -1 will be blocked
//2 ELSE             Special rule matching any unmatched destinations
